Implement four quadrants (just like the Microsoft logo) using react with reusability. And after that, whenever I click on a box, it should show clicked on that particular box, and when I click on another box it should show clicked in that box and disappear in another box. ( without any code redundancy)
Algo
step 1)Create one component for one quadrants
step 2) create a component that composes of 4 step1 components
step 3) handle click events on each component
